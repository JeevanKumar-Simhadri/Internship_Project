<h1><b>IMPACT STRENGTH::</b></h1>
<p> Impact strength is used to measure the materials ability to withstand shock loading. It is the energy required to fracture a given material. </p>
<h3><b>Description of apparatus:: </b></h3>
<p> The pendulum impact-testing machine consists of the robust frame, the pendulum, the specimen support and the measuring dial. The pendulum shaft is fitted in antifriction bearings. The pendulum is clamped to the pendulum shaft. The pendulum consists of the pendulum pipe and the pendulum hammer of U-shaped design. Into this, the striker is mounted for conducting impact test. The range, within which the pendulum is swinging, is partially protected by the guard. A latch is provided which keeps the pendulum in elevated position. A lever is provided for operating the latch and releasing the pendulum. There is a dial attached concentrically with the pendulum shaft. The scale is designed such that the impact energy absorbed in breaking the specimen can be read directly in Joules. Impact strength with u-notch=KCU=ratio of the energy absorbed in kg-m to the cross notch measured in cm before test. 
KCU 10/3 indicates that the test was conducted with 10 kg-m striking energy on the test piece with 3mm deep notch. If during the test, piece is not completely broken, the impact value obtained is indefinite. </p>
<h3><b>THEORY:: </b></h3>
<p>The ordinary tensile and bending tests are no true criterion for the impact resisting quality of a material. For the components subjected to shock and impact, the impact properties are to be studied. Here a specimen with a standard “V” groove is prepared and is broken by a swinging pendulum striker. A portion of potential energy of the pendulum is used to break the specimen and is recorded as absorbed energy of the specimen in a dial. This value divided by the Area of cross section gives the impact strength.  
</p> 
<h3><b>PROCEDURE: </b></h3>
<p> <b> Determination of error due to friction: </b><br>
1) The impact testing machine involves a pendulum swinging in vertical plane about a  horizontal shaft, housed in bearing. <br>
2) These bearing exert a frictional resistance if proper lubrication is not done. To estimate the losses the error test is carried out as follows <br>
3)The load carrier is carried is adjusted to the specified position for the specified position for the test being conducted. The pendulum is left hanging free vertically.<br> 
4) At rest position the dummy pointer is adjusted to 164 Joules for Izod test . <br>
5) The hammer is released by operating the proper level. The hammer is swings freely and carried the dummy pointer the direction of swing to a particular reading on the dial <br>  
6) if this reading is zero, the machine is in order. Otherwise the reading indicates the energy loss due to friction, which is accounted for in the calculations. <br>
<b>Determination of impact strength in Izod test:</b> <br>
1) A test piece of overall length of 75 mm and a square cross sectional of 10 mm side with a central V-notch 5 mm deep is employed for the test. The notch is at 28mm from one end. <br>
2) The hammer is lifted to have an initial potential energy of 164 Joules. It is released with  out shock and is allowed to strike the specimen and swing to the other side. <br>
3) The pendulum is raised to its position for the Izod test and is latched in the Izod test specimen placed in its position and properly secured as a vertical cantilever with the notch towards striking edge<br>
4) After it has reached the maximum height on the other end is in the process of swing back, it is brought to rest by the application of breaks and manually. <br>
5) The reading indicating by the pointer is recorded 6) For each material, the test is repeated twice and average value is noted.  <br>
<b>Determination of impact strength in Charpy test: </b><br>

1) A test piece of overall length of 55 mm and a square cross sectional of 10 mm side with a central U-notch 5 mm deep is employed for the test.  <br> 
2) It is placed in the Charpy impact-testing machine as a simply supported span of 40mm. The notch is adjusted to be it the center and such that it is on the tension side. <br>
3) The hammer is lifted to have an initial potential energy of 300 J. It shocks and is allowed to strike the specimen and swing to the other side.<br>
4) After it has reached the maximum height on the other end is in the process of swing back, it is brought to rest by the application of breaks and manually. <br>
5) The reading indicating by the pointer is recorded. <br> 
6) For each material, the test is repeated twice and average value is noted. </p>
