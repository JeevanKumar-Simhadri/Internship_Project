<h1><b>DESCRIPTION OF APPARATUS:</b></h1>
<p>The UTM consists of a testing unit and control unit. The testing unit is equipped with hydraulic piston and cylinder. This piston has two cross heads, a bottom and a top cross head are rigidly fixed. There is another cross head called adjustable cross head can be raised or lowered by the rotation of screw spindle. The control unit has an oil tank from which oil under pressure is delivered to the cylinder of the testing unit by means of a hydraulic pump. The rate at which oil is pumped can be controlled, which means that the rate of application of load can be controlled. When the oil under pressure enters the cylinder in the testing unit it lifts the piston up due to the upward force. Along with the piston the bottom and top cross heads also move up. Since the adjustable cross head will be stationary, during the test, the specimen held between the top cross and the adjustable cross head will be pulled apart and the specimen will be subjected to tension.</p>
<h3><b>THEORY:</b></h3>
<ul>
<li><b>1.Stress:</b>
<p>Stress is the resistance offered by the body to external load. It will be measured force per unit area.</p>
</li>
<li><b>2.Strain:</b>
<p>when the load is applied on a body, it tends to change the shape of the body in its direction the change effected is called deformation. The deformation expressed on the basis of the unit dimensions is called strain.</p> 
</li>
<li><b>3.Gauge length:</b>
<p>It is the reference length over which extension is measured.</p>
</li>
<li><b>4.Yield stress:</b>
<p>Stress at which considerable elongation occurs without increase in load.</p>
</li>
<li><b>5.Ultimate Tensile stress:</b> 
<p>The max. load reached in a tension test divided by the original cross section. This is also termed as tensile stress.</p>
</li>
<li><b>6.Modulus of Elasticity:</b>
<p>The ratio of normal stress to the axial strain with in the elastic limit. This also termed as young modulus.</p>
</li>
<li><b>7.% Elongation:</b>
<p>The permanent clongation of the gauge length aller breaking cxpressed as % of the original gauge length. If the % is >15% it can be classified as ductile material.</p> 
 </li>
<li><b>8.% Reduction area:</b>
<p>The change in the cross-section area, which has occurred at the neck, expressed as a percentage of the original cross-section.</p> 
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Procedure</b></h3>
<p>The diameter of the given specimen in found out with the help of the micrometer at two or three places. The center point of the specimen is located and half the value of gauge length set off on either side of it using the scale. Punch marks are made at these extreme points to facilitate mounting of the specimen. 

The test specimen is fixed at its upper end in the top crosshead by operating the hand wheel and locking lever. The adjustable cross head is moved up to the necessary height, by operating the motor and screw with the help of push button located on the machine. The lower end of the test specimen is gripped in it and locked. The dials of extensometer are adjusted to zero. Starts the pump that operates the piston with the help of push buttons located on the machine. Slowly turn the hand wheel, which controls the load on specimen. Set the wheel at a position, which gives a gradual increase in load. Observe the dial and note 

i) The load at the point where it momentarily stops. This indicates yield point. At this point without increase in load, the component elongates. 

ii) The maximum load indicated by the dial. This is to be observed carefully, because after the point the component deforms at a faster rate and breaks. This load indicates ultimate load. 

iii) The load after component breaks which gives the load at fracture. Release the load by operating load release hand wheel. Unlock the jaw and remove the specimen. Measure and note the final diameter and final length. 

Note: Take down eight readings of dial before the yield point.</p>
