<h1>2. TORSION TEST ON SOLID CIRCULAR SHAFT </h1>
<h3><b>Aim.</b></h3>
<p>To study the behaviors of mild steel when subjected to a gradually increasing torque and to determine the following: 
i) Modulus of rigidity of the material  
ii) Yield point in shear 
iii) Modulus of rupture (torsion) </p>

<h1><b>Torsion testing machine:</b></h1>
<p>The machine consists essentially of a drive unit, a weighing head, a torque indicator and a dial from which the angle of twist can be read. 

The base is a rigid frame made up of the drive unit frame, two columns and the weighing head. The machine can be operated either manually or mechanically by an electrical motor. In manual operation, the machine is driven by means of a crank. The selector switch should be set in the intermediate position so as to disable the gears which operate the mechanical operation. In mechanical operation, the electric motor actuates the warm gear, through a V belt which drives the screw lead and the lower grip. 

The twisting angle may be read from the dial, which is graduated in degree for one full revolution. The purpose of the weighting head is to balance the torque of the drive unit. At the bottom end the weighing head receives the upper grip. The balancing torque is provided by a sector that is flexibly coupled with a pendulum. 
The pendulum is suspended from a bush and is linked with a rack and the dash pot of the torque indicator. The pendulum has loose weights which are chosen in accordance with the torque indicator range to be used in a test. 
The torque indicator employed in the machine is of the pendulum type. The torque applied to the upper grip through the specimen causes the pendulum in the weighing head to deflect until the torque built up by the pendulum balances the torque applied to the specimen by the motor. In deflecting, the pendulum actuates the toothed rack which in turns drives the pinion scated on the shaft of the main pointer of the circular torquc dial. The machine can build up three ranges of torque i.e., 0-10 kg-m, 0-20 kg-m, 0-50 kg-m. </p>
<h3><b>Troptometer:</b></h3>

<p>This instrument is used to measure twist to an accuracy of one minute. It consists of two collars secured to the specimen at a given distance or gauge length apart. A steam of length cqual to the gauge length and fixed to the bottom collar projects towards the top collar. A dial gauge is fixed to the top collar such that its spindle moves tangential to the collar. An inextensible string is lied from the steam to the spindle of the dial gauge. Due to the relative twist of the specimen under torsion, over the gauge length, the steam pulls the string and hence the spindle of the dial gauge, which records the movement in mm. The radius of the collar is so chosen that one mm reading of the dial gauge corresponds to one minute twist of the specimen over the gauge length.</p>

<h3><b>THEORY: </b></h3>
<p>A circular bar, when subjected to torque, will be twisted. Shearing stresses are developed in any cross-section of the bar whose value increases linearly from zero at the center of a maximum at the outer periphery. The relation between the applied torque, the developed stresses and the angular twist is given by the equation T/J=fX/r=Cα/L ,where T is the applied torque, J is the polar moment of inertia of the L cross section of the bar, f, is the magnitude of shear stress at radius r, C is the modulus of rigidity and is the angle of twist over a length L of the bar. Therefore the modulus = = 9 of rigidity can be computed from the equation C= (T/α)(L/J) . T/α is the slope of the  graph of the Torque vs Twist. The yield point shear stress is calculated from the equation (fs) TxR -ⓇR where Ty is torque at the yield point and R is the outer most radius of the shaft .</p> 
<h3><b>PROCEDURE: </b></h3>
<p>The diameter of the bar is measured at two or three place and the average value is obtained. The parallel length of the bar is also measured. A straight line is drawn, parallel to the axis of the bar, with a piece of chalk. This is to study how the specimen twists when subjected to the torque.
The specimen is fixed in position in the torsion testing machine. For the elastic range torque is applied manually, and the twist recorded at regular intervals from the Troptometer. After the yield point, the required torque is applied by the electric motor. The twist of the free end of the bar, as indicated by the dial is noted for regular increments of supplied torque. The specimen is tested till fractures noting down the value of the torque, which causes the fracture, and also the nature of the fracture </p>
