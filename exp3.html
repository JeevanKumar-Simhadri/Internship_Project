<h1><b>HARDNESS:</b></h1>
<p>Hardness is a property exhibited by all materials. The amount of resistance offered by a metal for indentation or penetration is defined as the indentation hardness or hardness of a metal. Its measurement is important because its close relationship with the strength of the part and wear resistance. An empirical relationship between the ultimate tensile strength and the BHN have been found for low and medium strength carbon and alloys steels. This relationship is 

  

Sut = 3.45 BHN in MPa . </p>
<h3><b>THEORY: </b></h3>

<p> Brinell hardness is determined by forcing a hard steel or carbide sphere of a specified diameter under a specified load into the surface of a material and measuring the diameter of the indentation left after the test. The Brinell hardness number, or simply the Brinell number, is obtained by dividing the load used in kilograms, by the actual surface area of the indentation, in square millimeters. To make it easier, a calibrated chat is provided, so with the diameter of the indentation, the corresponding hardness number can be referenced. </p>

<h3><b>Description of Apparatus: </b></h3>
<p>The machine is a direct reading type, the dial consists of two pointers. The small pointer is used for Rockwell Hardness test: Workpiece supporting table can be moved up and down by slowly turning the hand wheel. Load selector wheel help to set the load based on indenter used. There is a lever to apply and remove the load. The HB = load(P)/surface area of indentation a 
</p> 
<h3><b>PROCEDURE: </b></h3>
<p>Keep the lever at normal position, fix the indenter and tighten the screw. Set the load load selector wheel. You can hear a small “click” indicating that the setting of by tuming the given load. The surface of the material to be tested is first cleaned of dirt, oil scale etc. the surface is rubbed with sandpaper to facilitate reading of the impression. Place the specimen on the supporting table and turn the hand wheel slowly so as to lift it upwards. Now apply the load by slowly changing the position of hand lever from normal position to load position. Keep the load for 10 to 15 sec. Remove the load by slowly bringing the lever to normal position. Two diameters of impression at right angles are measured, and the mean diameter is used as a basis for calculating the Brinell hardness number. The value can be cross checked with the values given in calibrated chart.  </p>
