<p><b>Apparatus</b></p>
<a href="https://universaltestingmachines.co.in/images/saroj-make-rockwell-hardness-testing-machine.jpg"> Rockwell Hardness Testing Machine  </a> <br>
<ul>
<li>a diamond cone of 120° apex angle with adaptorl </li>
<li> 1/16 inches steel ball with adaptor,   </li>
<li> Allen key </li>
</ul>
<h1><b>HARDNESS:</b></h1>
<p> Hardness is a property exhibited by all materials. The amount of resistance offered by a metal for indentation or penetration is defined as the indentation hardness or hardness of a metal. Its measurement is important because its close relationship with the strength of the part and wear resistance. . </p>
<h3><b>Description of apparatus:: </b></h3>
<p> The machine is a direct reading type, the dial consists of two pointers. The small pointer, which is situated in the top, left quarter of the dial, shows the application of minor load 10 kg. Work piece supporting table can be moved up and down by slowly turning the hand wheel. Load selector wheel help to set the load based on indenter used. There is a lever to apply and remove the major load. Selection of indenters and scale: The common indenters employed in the Rockwell hardness tester are a 1/16 steel ball and a diamond cone. When the former is employed, the major load is maintained at 100 inch hardened kg and the hardness valve read on 'B' scale. The 'B' scale is suitable to test carbon steels, non-ferrous metals and alloYs like copper, bronze etc. For testing very hard materials like hardened steel a diamond indenter is employed. It consists of n 120" conical shaped diamond with a 0.2 mm diameter . The major load 150 kg is maintained the hardness is rend an C scale. Most commonly used Rockwell scales 'B' and 'C' consists of 0-100 divisions. But these are staggered is such a fashion that the B-30 at C-o it is made so to avoid the negative hardness values of the B scale if used to test very soft materials.  </p>
<h3><b>THEORY:: </b></h3>
<p>Rockwell hardness test method consists of indenting the test material with diamond cone or hardened steel ball indenter. The indenter is forced into the test material under a preliminary minor load, Fo usually 10 kgf. When equilibrium has been reached, an indicating device, which follows the movements of the indenter and so responds to changes in depth of penetration of the indenter, is set to a datum position. While the preliminary minor load is still applied an additional major load is applied with resulting increase in penetration. When equilibrium has again been reach, the additional major load is removed but the preliminary minor load is still maintained. Removal of the additional major load allows a partial recovery, so reducing the depth of penetration. The permanent increase in depth of penetration, resulting from the application and removal of the additional major load is used to calculate the Rockwell hardness number. 
HR=E-e 
Fo= preliminary minor load in kgf  
F1 = =additional major load in kgf 
F = total load in kgf  
e = permanent increase in depth of penetration due to major load F, measured in units of 0.002 mm 
E = a constant depending on form of indenter 100 units for diamond indenter, 130 units for steel ball indenter 
HR = Rockwell hardness number 
D = diameter of steel ball  
</p> 
<h3><b>PROCEDURE: </b></h3>
<p> Keep the lever at normal position, fix the indenter and tighten the screw. Set the major load try tuning the load selector wheel. You can hear a small “click” indicating that the setting of given load. Place the given specimen on the supporting table and turn the hand wheel slowly so as to lift it upwards. The small pointer Start to move once the specimen touches the indenter, continue to move the supporting table up till the small pointer reaches the red dot on the dial. This indicates application of minor load on the specimen. Now apply the major load by slowly changing the position of hand lever from normal position to load position. Keep the load for 10 to 15 sec. Remove the major load by slowly bringing the lever to normal position. The reading on relevant scale indicates Hardness of the material. </p>
